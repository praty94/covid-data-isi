            "question":"What is the purpose of this dashboard?",
            "answer":"The primary aim of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights to facilitate the process of phased unlocking of the economy. Accordingly this dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of the COVID–19 situation in India as a whole, in the different states / UTs, and in the districts within states / UTs. It gives an idea about the possible risks and provides a comprehensive picture of what worked and what did not."

        {
            "question":"How is this dashboard different from other dashboards?",
            "answer":"This dashboard attempts to go beyond reporting and aims at facilitating decision making. Accordingly, this dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of the COVID–19 situation as well as a risk summary. The risk summary should enable the policy makers to identify focus areas. Further, a weekly summary report is prepared to describe the data from different perspectives. This should enable users of the dashboard to understand trends and relationship between different variables."

        {
            "question":"Which dimensions did you consider in this dashboard?",
            "answer":"The COVID–19 situation may be described through a number of characteristics like rate of occurrence of new cases, breakup of confirmed cases by severity, rate of recovery, number of active cases, rate of testing, rate of detection of new cases through tests, death rate etc. When measured and presented appropriately, each of these characteristics communicate a different aspect of the overall scenario. Sometimes, combination of a few characteristics may also be used. These characteristics or their combinations are called dimensions. We attempted to cover all the dimensions and a few others  not described above. We also included some composite dimensions obtained by combining values of two or more directly observed dimensions. Although we intended to cover many dimensions, a few like breakup of confirmed cases by severity could not be covered as data were not available."
        },
        {
            "question":"How do these dimensions provide a holistic view of the COVID–19 scenario?",
            "answer":"As stated earlier, each of the dimensions being studied provide a different view of the underlying situation. A few examples would clarify the matter.<br/><strong>1.</strong>  Increasing trend of occurrence of new cases is likely to indicate that the virus is spreading.<br/><strong>2.</strong>  Increasing trend of active cases indicates possibility of increased stress on resources at present or in the near future.<br/><strong>3.</strong>  The ratio of confirmed cases to recovery, often referred to as traffic intensity, is a leading indicator of stress on resources. Traffic Intensity greater than 1 implies faster arrival of new cases compared to recovery. Higher values of traffic intensity may lead to resource crunch.<br/><strong>4.</strong>  Higher proportion positive test result on a larger test population (possibly less targeting) is anomalous and needs investigation. There are at least three possibilities, <strong>a)</strong> rapid increase of rate of infection, <strong>b)</strong> carrying out tests in new (hitherto untested) areas with high but unknown rate of infection, and <strong>c)</strong> improper in testing itself leading to many incorrectly positive results.<br/><strong>5.</strong>  Large variability of characteristics within short time intervals may indicate systemic issues. For example, large variability of new cases across subsequent days may be due to issues in testing or reporting system. Quick increase of new cases with low fatality may be due to large number of mild / asymptomatic cases that is not risky, and may call for different type of reporting.<br/>    Clearly, each dimension provides a unique view and its quantitative value may be used to assess risk. Evidently, examining the scenario from multiple perspectives provides a holistic view and gives an idea about the potential risks. As mentioned earlier, this dashboard provides a multi-dimensional risk summary for the entire country as well as states. Attempts are being made to bring out risk summary at district level. This will facilitate initiating actions suitable to specific regions.<br/> <strong>Note: </strong> Currently data on all identified characteristics are not available at state / district level. Consequently, certain measures are not being reported in the current version of the dashboard."

        {
            "question":"How do we use this dashboard?",
            "answer":" This dashboard is primarily meant for policy makers. It provides multi-dimensional view and risk summary for the states. The policy makers may use this to assess risk at state / district and even ward level, if data are available. Accordingly, actions may be tailored to suit the requirements of specific regions. This is very likely to increase the effectiveness of the actions."

            "question":"How many states can be selected for comparison?",
            "answer":" Depends on user. You can select any number and any combination of states for comparison."
        },
        {
            "question":"What is traffic intensity? Why is it calculated?",
            "answer":" It is ratio of confirmed cases to recovered cases in a particular time span. Traffic Intensity greater than 1 indicates that new cases are arriving faster than recovery. Higher values of traffic intensity tends to inundate the system."
        },
        {
            "question":"What is Spread? Why is it calculated?",
            "answer":" Spread is calculated for states. For a particular state it is the proportion of districts having 100 or more cases. Higher value of spread is likely to be risky as potential threat of rapid increase of infection exists in many districts. The value 100 is a little arbitrary. As of May 31, approximately 70% of the districts of the top 16 states with respect to the cumulative number of confirmed cases had less than 100 cases."

            "answer":"Live data is taken from Google sheet api provided by <a href='https://api.covid19india.org/' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>covid19india.org</a> , which is taken from state bulletins and official handles. The data is validated by a group of volunteers."
