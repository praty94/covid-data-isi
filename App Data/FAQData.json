            "answer":"The primary aim of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights to facilitate the process of phased unlocking of the economy. Accordingly this dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of the COVID–19 situation in India as a whole, in the different states / UTs, and in the districts within states / UTs. It gives an idea about the possible risks and provides a comprehensive picture of what worked and what did not."

            "question":"How is this dashboard different from other dashboards?",
            "answer":"The COVID–19 situation may be described through a number of characteristics like rate of occurrence of new cases, breakup of confirmed cases by severity, rate of recovery, number of active cases, rate of testing, rate of detection of new cases through tests, death rate, extent of spread of the virus across districts of a state / UT etc. When measured and presented appropriately, each of these characteristics communicate a different aspect of the overall scenario. Sometimes, combination of a few characteristics may be also be used. A few examples are given below.<br/>1.  Increasing trend of occurrence of new cases is likely to indicate that the virus is spreading.<br/>2.  b.Increasing trend of active cases indicates possibility of increased stress on resources at present or in the near future.<br/>3.  The ratio of confirmed cases to recovery, often referred to as traffic intensity, is a leading indicator of stress on resources. Traffic Intensity greater than 1 implies faster arrival of new cases compared to recovery that is likely to lead to resource crunch.<br/>4.  Higher proportion positive test result on a larger test population (possibly less targeting) is anomalous and needs investigation. There are at least three possibilities, a) rapid increase of rate of infection, b) carrying out tests in new (hitherto untested) areas with high but unknown rate of infection, and c) problem in testing itself leading to many incorrectly positive results.<br/>5.  e.Large variability of characteristics within short time intervals may indicate systemic issues. For example, large variability of new cases across subsequent days may be due to issues in testing system. Quick increase of new cases with low fatality may be due to very large number of mild / asymptomatic cases that is not risky, and may call for different type of reporting.<br/>Evidently, examining the scenario from multiple perspectives provides a holistic view and gives an idea about the potential risks. This dashboard provides a multi-dimensional risk summary for the entire country as well as states. Attempts are being made to bring out risk summary at district level. This will facilitate calibrating actions suitable to specific regions.<br/> <strong>Note</strong>:  Currently data on all identified characteristics are not available at state / district level. Consequently, certain measures are not being reported in the current version of the dashboard."

            "question":"How do we use this dashboard?",
            "answer":" This dashboard is primarily meant for policy makers. It provides multi-dimensional view and risk summary for the states. The policy makers may use this to assess risk at state / district and even ward level, if data are available."

        {
            "question":"How many states can be selected for comparison?",
            "answer":" Depends on user. You can select any number and any combination of states for comparison."
        },
        {
            "question":"What is traffic intensity? Why is it calculated?",
            "answer":"It is ratio of confirmed cases to recovered cases in a particular time span. It can be used to forecast / check the healthcare capability of a particular state. Lower the traffic intensity, greater is the chance to flatten the curve."
        },
        {
            "question":"What is Spread?",
            "answer":"For a particular state it is defined as propotion of number of districs having atleast 100 confirmed cases."

            "question":"What are your data sources? How is the data gathered for this project?",
            "answer":"Live data is taken from Google sheet api provided by <a href='https://api.covid19india.org/' target='_blank' style='color: inherit;'>covid19india.org</a> , which is taken from state bulletins and official handles. The data is validated by a group of volunteers."

            "answer":" In the Dashboard page you can click on the option  <strong>State and District level data</strong> to get the State wise data. Yo can click on any state to get the District wise data "
