            "answer":"The primary aim of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights to facilitate the process of phased unlocking of the economy. Accordingly this dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of the COVID–19 situation in India as a whole, in the different states / UTs, and in the districts within states / UTs. It gives an idea about the possible risks and provides a comprehensive picture of what worked and what did not."

            "question":"How is this dashboard different from other dashboards?",
            "answer":"The COVID–19 situation may be described through a number of characteristics like rate of occurrence of new cases, breakup of confirmed cases by severity, rate of recovery, number of active cases, rate of testing, rate of detection of new cases through tests, death rate, extent of spread of the virus across districts of a state / UT etc. When measured and presented appropriately, each of these characteristics communicate a different aspect of the overall scenario. Sometimes, combination of a few characteristics may be also be used. A few examples are given below."

            "answer":"It is ratio of confirmed cases to recovered cases in a particular time span. It can be used to forecast / check the healthcare capability of a particular state. Lower the traffic intensity, greater is the chance to flatten the curve."
        },
        {
            "question":"What is concentration? Why is it calculated?",
            "answer":"For a particular state it is (Number of districts having at least 75% of cases) / (total number of districts in that state) , i.e. Lower value of concentration indicates that cases are concentrated in few districts only. It can be used to check the spread of the pandemic, lower concentration implies less spread."
